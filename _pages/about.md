I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the UNITES Lab at [UNC Chapel Hill CS](https://cs.unc.edu/unc-ai/), under [Prof. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/). My research focuses on agentic and multimodal AI for healthcare, as well as AI for science including protein and genomic language modeling. I recently completed my Ph.D. in machine learning at Duke University under [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/), where my research focused on deep learning and computer vision for medical image analysis, with an emphasis on generative models, domain adaptation, and generalization analysis.

I'm also interested in how foundational deep learning concepts--such as [generalization](https://nickk124.github.io/research/#intrinsic-properties-of-image-data-manifolds-and-their-effects-on-neural-network-generalization) and [image distribution distance metrics](https://nickk124.github.io/research/#image-distribution-similarity-metrics-and-generative-models)--need to be adapted for specialized domains like medical imaging, and how [intrinsic manifold properties](https://nickk124.github.io/research/#intrinsic-properties-of-image-data-manifolds-and-their-effects-on-neural-network-generalization) of training data govern model learning and generalization.

Previously, I worked as a research intern at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/) in AI interpretability, and earned my undergraduate degree at UNC, double-majoring in physics and mathematics, where I conducted research on statistical techniques for astronomy under [Dan Reichart](https://www.danreichart.com/).
