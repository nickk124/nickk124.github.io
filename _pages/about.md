I'm a Ph.D. candidate studying machine learning at Duke University, working under [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/). My research focuses on deep learning for medical image analysis on a spectrum from application-oriented to foundational work, with an emphasis on topics like generative models, domain adaptation, and image-to-image translation.

I am also particularly interested in how foundational deep learning concepts--such as [generalization, intrinsic geometric properties of real-world datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08865), and [image distribution distance metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496)--behave in medical image analysis and other secondary computer vision domains. This includes exploring how these concepts need to be adapted for unique challenges in these fields.

Beyond medical imaging, I'm drawn to the intersection of machine learning and science: understanding deep learning through a scientific lens, and leveraging it for scientific modeling, discovery, and applications in science-adjacent domains.

Previously, I worked as a research intern in the Math, Stats, and Data Science Group at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I earned my undergraduate degree at UNC, double-majoring in physics and mathematics, where I conducted research on statistical techniques for astronomy.
