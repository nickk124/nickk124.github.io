      abstract={Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.}

  abstract={In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.}
