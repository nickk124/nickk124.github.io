Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496) introducing Fréchet Radiomic Distance (FRD), has been accepted to [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841526000125)! FRD is a new metric for evaluating the similarity of sets of medical images, *e.g.*, to measure the quality of synthetic images with respect to real images. It leverages radiomic features to better capture the unique characteristics of medical images, and outperforms existing metrics in wide-ranging evaluations.
