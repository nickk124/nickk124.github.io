I'm very excited to announce that I will be joining the UNITES Lab at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** under [Prof. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/) starting in early 2026! My research will focus on multimodal AI for healthcare and science. I'm looking forward to this new chapter and the opportunity to work with this incredibly talented team!
